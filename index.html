          <h3>What Makes a Dictator</h3>
          <p> Every dictator should possess the qualities of nationalism, confidence, and bravery. Nationalism is needed to become a powerful dictator. It is necessary because if you are not nationalistic about your cause, you will not be extremely enthusiastic about it. That leads to making a bad dictator because a dictator needs to be confident and he can't do that when he is not enthusiastic. The next thing needed is confidence. You need confidence because if you don't have it, you will not be able to make the decisions you want with efficiency. If you are not efficient and confident in yourself, then the people under your power might rebel against you. The final trait necessary to become a powerful dictator is to be brave. You would need to be brave in a number of ways to be a good dictator. First of all, you would need to inspire people to your cause by the means of something like a speech. If you do not have anyone in your cause, what are you going to dictate. In conclusion, to be a good dictator you need to have the characteristics of nationalism, confidence, and bravery.</p><br>

          <h3>Dictatorship Environment</h3>
          <p>  
Hitler rose to power in 1933. Hitler had gone through many things to make him a dictator. One of the first reasons was because he was in WWI and was outraged that the Germans surrendered. Hitler didn’t start the Nazi party. He found them and they shared common hates and interests. He joined their party and eventually rose to their leader for being a strong and inspiring preacher. He came to power over Germany by vote. The president had elected him to become the chancellor.  A couple of months after this a fire burnt down a building and the government was held responsible. Hitler then rose above the government. Many people think that this was by Nazi doing so that Hitler could rise to power. The only reason that Hitler could do this was because of the conditions of Germany and its people. The environment was right for Hitler to become a dictator because of political, social, and economical unrest.
<br><br><br>
The first reason that Hitler rose to power was because of political unrest and hatred of the government. People hated the government for signing the treaty of Versailles. There is a German legend called “Dolchstosslegende.” This means stab in the back legend. Many people were rebelling against the Weimar Republic. A fair amount of these people were in extremist groups like Hitler. Hitler was even sent to jail for treason against the Weimar republic. People were constantly protesting for new government. There were a number of riots against the Weimar republic and a lot protesting. Political unrest was a major reason that Hitler was able to become a dictator over Germany.
<br><br><br>
Secondly, social unrest in the environment was a prime reason Hitler came to power. Germans were blaming other people besides the government for their problems. Many Jewish people were the target of this anger. The Germans saw that the Jews were doing well in their own country while they were in great poverty. The German people were very frustrated and angry when the U.S. drew out its loans. Germany was very reliant on trade and foreign countries. The US drew out and some Germans blamed them for their suffering. One of the rules of the treaty of Versailles was that Germany and Austria could not join together and work together. They had a shared ethnic group so they were naturally angry. “Austrian is like the German, isn’t it, in general”(Supreme Court: Appellate Division-First Judicial Department: Royal Indemnity, 1931)? This quote shows that the Germans and Austrians were basically one in the same. Splitting them up enraged them. Social frustration was a major reason Hitler could come in and take over. Without the frustration he could not have done it.
 <br><br><br>
Lastly, economic problems and the promise of better wealth were the Hitler’s trump card to becoming a dictator. When the Weimar republic was still in power they overprinted paper money. This hyper inflated their economic system. “My father was a lawyer and he had taken out an insurance policy in 1903, and every month he had made the payments faithfully. It was a 20-year policy, and when it came due, he cashed it in and bought a single loaf of bread.” (Walter Levy, 1923) To make it even worse, more and more people were losing their jobs and becoming unemployed. This added to the depression because of the huge reparation debt Germany was in. With each unemployment, the harder it was to pay back the debt. People all over Germany were losing their money. Many wealthier people’s accounts were completely demolished by these debts and the inflation. So the poverty grew.
<br><br><br>
Hitler then came in an and promised no more poverty and inflation. He promised that everyone would have a job. That is why the people were so eager to have him lead. There were very specific conditions that allowed Hitler to come to power. The first were the political problems and unrest. The second was social frustration. Many people held a myriad of emotions on their current situation. Most of them were bad. The last reason was the economic instability and poverty of the people. With all of these conditions in front of him, Hitler could easily swoop in and take over Germany.<br><br><br>
              <h2>Here is an example of the inflation</h2>

                <h4>Hitler could take over Germany because of these 3 reasons</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>  Economic Unstability </li>
                    <li>
                    Policitical Unstability
                    </li>
                    <li> Social Unrest</li>
                
                
                
                </ul>
